## Overview

This project implements a deep learning model for multi-class image classification using TensorFlow and Keras. The training was conducted in two distinct phases with an efficient combination of layer structuring and training strategies.

### Training Phases

#### Phase 1: Aggressive Training with High Learning Rate

- **Learning Rate:** Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01
- **Training Epochs:** 8 epochs
- **Layer Structure:**
    - Pretrained "InceptionResNetV2" model
    - Global Average Pooling 2D layer
    - Dense output layer (activation="softmax")

#### Phase 2: Fine-Tuning with Lower Learning Rate and Dropout Layer

- **Model Initialization:** Loaded the best model from Phase 1
- **Dropout:** Added a `Dropout(0.15)` layer to prevent overfitting
- **Dense Layers:** Final Dense output layer with softmax activation.
- Other configurations with the follow  did not improve performance significantly.
     - additional ReLU-activated dense layers
     - trying unfreezing top30 layers, top100, last 30
     - Applying weights to attended features using "Multiply()([x, attention_weights])" before procedding to concatenating GAP2D GMP2D
     - Other attempts to introduce some non-linearity

### Dataset Details

- **Path:** `C:/Projects Temp/Pixel Play/dataset`
    - **Train Directory:** `/train`
    - **Validation Directory:** `/validate`
- **Number of Classes:** `NumberOfSpecies` (calculated as the count of directories in the training folder)

## Code Highlights

### Preprocessing Pipelines

#### Data Generators

- **Training Data:** Applied horizontal flip, zoom range, rotation, and rescaling.
- **Validation & Test Data:** Only applied rescaling.

#### Code Snippet

```python
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
    rescale=1.0 / 255,
    horizontal_flip=True,
    zoom_range=0.1,
    rotation_range=15
)
```

### Model Architecture

- Used the pretrained `InceptionResNetV2` as the base, frozen initially.
- Included custom classification layers tailored to the number of species.

#### Key Model Components

```python
inputs = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(224, 224, 3))
x = base_model(inputs, training=False)
x = tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x)
x = tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.15)(x)  # 15% Dropout
outputs = tf.keras.layers.Dense(NumberOfSpecies, activation="softmax", name="Output_Layer")(x)
model = tf.keras.Model(inputs, outputs)
```

### Training Configuration

- **Optimizer:** Adam with adaptive learning rate
- **Loss Function:** Categorical crossentropy
- **Metrics:** Accuracy

#### Callbacks Used

1. **ModelCheckpoint:** Save the best model based on validation accuracy.
2. **ReduceLROnPlateau:** Reduce the learning rate on a plateau.
3. **EarlyStopping:** Stop training early if performance stagnates.

### Evaluation & Plotting

- **Performance Evaluation:** The model’s accuracy was validated on unseen test data.
- **Loss & Accuracy Visualization:** Training and validation performance plotted for analysis.

```python
def plot_loss_curves(history):
    loss = history.history["loss"]
    val_loss = history.history["val_loss"]
    accuracy = history.history["accuracy"]
    val_accuracy = history.history["val_accuracy"]
    epochs = range(len(loss))

    # Plot Loss
    plt.plot(epochs, loss, label="Training Loss")
    plt.plot(epochs, val_loss, label="Validation Loss")
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

    # Plot Accuracy
    plt.plot(epochs, accuracy, label="Training Accuracy")
    plt.plot(epochs, val_accuracy, label="Validation Accuracy")
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()
```
